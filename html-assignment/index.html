            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is <b>Nick Rogers</b> I am 21 years old and I was born in Ottawa, Ontario on July 15<sup>th</sup>
                2002. I spent my whole life living in Ottawa with my mom, grandma and older brother and they are the
                best family I could ask for. I grew up playing alot of sports such as hockey, soccer and football but my
                favorite and the one I excelled in the most was basketball. I was really good at basketball because of
                my height and athleticism along with the skills I had begun to develop. I would train every day and
                play with my friends from school until The coach from the team had noticed me and asked me if I would
                like to play for the team of my middle school and I said yes and was eager to start practicing and
                playing for a real team.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my first year in middle school I was the best player on the team by far because of how dedicated how was to playing basketball and how talentend I was at such a young age. I had an advantage over my opponents because of skilled I was and my height, at 13 I was 6 <abbr title="Foot">ft</abbr> which at my age is very tall so I was <em>unstoppable</em> on the basketball court and it showed. I lead my school to the finals with consistent performances from me and my team and the whole time I was playing with and injured hand but that did not stop me from showing out for me and my team and it was a tough game that we ended up losing by just 2 points. Even with this heartbreaking loss I looked at improving myself instead of being hardheaded and mad, this was a lesson that stuck with me my whole life and I kept it.
